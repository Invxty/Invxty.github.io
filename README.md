Introduction:
This is my personal portfolio that demonstrates my current skills and creativity regarding html and css. This webpage is easy to navigate and contains
information that will help in knowing me better! <br>
<br>
Instructions: <br>
This portfolio is currently available only to zoom 75% to 110%, getting past these values will make the content too streched or squeezed in. No breakpoints were added. :( I will add them soon!<br><br>
Navigation:<br>
To navigate the portfolio, you can either use the navbar by clicking the respective buttons, or by using the arrow button found in every section of the portfolio.
These arrows will take you to the next section of the portfolio<br><br>

The first section, the home page, shows my name and intro to my webpage.<br>
The second section is the introduction page to the About me page.<br>
The third section is the about me page, this page showcases my skills, education, a short description of me, and a picture of me.<br>
The fourth section is the title page for my projects.<br>
The fifth section is where I showcased my project.<br>
