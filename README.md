Introduction:
This is my personal portfolio that demonstrates my current skills and creativity regarding html and css. This webpage is easy to navigate and contains <br>
information that will help in knowing me better! <br>
<br>
Instructions: <br>
This portfolio is currently available only to zoom 75% to 110%, getting past these values will make the content too streched or squeezed in. No breakpoints were added. :( I will add them soon!<br><br>
Navigation:<br>
To navigate the portfolio, you can either use the navbar by clicking the respective buttons, or by using the arrow button found in every section of the portfolio<br>
these arrows will take you to the next section of the portfolio<br>
